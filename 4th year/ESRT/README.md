# Emulação e Simulação de Redes de Telecomunicações (Emulation and Simulation of Telecommunication Networks)

* Understand the differences between network emulation, simulation, and real-world testing:
* When facing a problem in the field of networks and communication protocols, know how to choose the appropriate technique (emulation or simulation) for studying and evaluating solutions;
* Plan experiments using network emulators to assess applications, protocols, and communication mechanisms:
* Identify the fundamental components of a simulator and the internal architecture of discrete event-based network simulators;
* Prepare network simulations using discrete event simulators like NS-3 or Omnet++;
* Be capable of extending the functionalities of a well-known simulator like NS-3 or Omnet++ to evaluate a specific protocol or communication mechanism.
