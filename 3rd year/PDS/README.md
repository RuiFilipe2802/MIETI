# Processamento Digital de Sinal (Digital Signal Processing)

* In the face of the filtering problem at hand, know how to identify the best method for each specific case;
* Implement the most common filtering methods;
* Identify the most important properties of random phenomena and their degree of influence on the signals corrupted by them;
* Discuss and apply different methods for estimating the power spectral density in completely random or unpredictable processes;
* Discuss and apply different methods for estimating the power spectral density in autoregressive random processes or those with some degree of predictability;
* Discuss and apply various algorithms for signal detection in noise when only a very limited number of samples are available (high-resolution spectral methods);
* Discuss and apply different algorithms for direction of arrival estimation of radiant sources or pure reflectors, particularly in the context of adaptive antennas in the field of mobile communications.
